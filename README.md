# Using Travis for Continuous Integration
Brief notes on TravisCI
<ul>Travis is a tool that helps us with the CI process</ul>
<ul>Travis integrates with your application using a YAML file</ul>
<ul>YAML files are often used to specify configurations.</ul>
<ul>Travis can be used to build and push images to DockerHub</ul>

The Travis file is always named .travis.yml and stored in the top-level of your git directory. This is detected by Travis CI and turned into a build pipeline.
