# Using Travis for Continuous Integration

## Brief notes on TravisCI
<ul>
    <li>Travis is a tool that helps us with the CI process</li>
    <li>Travis integrates with your application using a YAML file</li>
    <li>YAML files are often used to specify configurations.</li>
    <li>Travis can be used to build and push images to DockerHub</li>
</ul>

The Travis file is always named .travis.yml and stored in the top-level of your git directory. This is detected by Travis CI and turned into a build pipeline.
