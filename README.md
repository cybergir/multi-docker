# Using Travis for Continuous Integration
Brief notes on TravisCI
<ul>
    <l1>Travis is a tool that helps us with the CI process</l1>
    <l1>Travis integrates with your application using a YAML file</l1>
    <l1>YAML files are often used to specify configurations.</l1>
    <l1>Travis can be used to build and push images to DockerHub</l1>
</ul>

The Travis file is always named .travis.yml and stored in the top-level of your git directory. This is detected by Travis CI and turned into a build pipeline.
